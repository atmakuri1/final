This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Meeting 1:
The Panda POS project is progressing well, with all pages now completed. This includes the redesign of the manager pages, which have been optimized for efficiency and given a more professional look. The redesign also incorporates new coloring, and the pages are nearly finalized. The team has made great strides in ensuring that the user interface is both functional and visually appealing.

Meeting 2:
In addition to completing the pages, the team successfully connected the trends page to the database. Work is still underway to finish the remaining database connections and implement the necessary APIs. This will allow for smooth data integration across the application. Hosting continues to be managed through Vercel, which has been set up without any issues.

Meeting 3:
While the project has been progressing smoothly overall, the team has faced challenges with time management and the complexity of the database connections. These issues have slowed progress slightly, but the team is actively addressing them. Looking ahead, the focus for the next sprint will be on finalizing the database integrations, completing the remaining API implementations, and bringing the project to completion.
